# *Robust Sim2Real transfer with deep reinforcement learning for Autonomous vehicles*

## About the work

## System Requirments



## Hardware
For real world application, we use the DB21 Duckiebot from [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/)

With advanced function, we update this Duckiebot with Lidar (RPLIDAR A1). If you are also interested in update your duckiebot withe Lidar, please check this [Blog](https://www.hackster.io/shahizat005/building-a-map-using-lidar-with-ros-melodic-on-jetson-nano-2f92dd).
