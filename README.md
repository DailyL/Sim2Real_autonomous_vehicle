# Robust-Sim2Real-transfer-with-deep-reinforcement-learning-for-Autonomous-vehicles

## About the work

## Hardware
For real world application, we use the DB21 Duckiebot from [Duckietown](https://www.duckietown.org/)
With advanced function, we update this Duckiebot with Lidar (RPLIDAR A1).

## Results
